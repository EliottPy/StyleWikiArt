# Style Wiki Art

## Context
This project was created in the context of my second year at CentraleSup√©lec with Etienne Andrier and Cyprien Fourcroy, under the supervision of Jean-Luc Collette and Michel Ianotto.

The goal of this project was to recognize the style and moovement of origin of a given painting.

## Dataset
We worked with WikiArt, with their 14-classes painting databases. From these classes, we decided to work on 6 of them (abstract, cityscape, genre-painting, landscape, portrait and religious paintings). We decided to choose only the most present classes to limit the scope of our work, considering the little time we had.

## Networks
We use 3 types of network : ConvNet, CNN and resnet. I worked on ConvNet, Etienne on the CNN and Cyprien on Resnet18.
ConvNet is independent from the rest of the project, and the other files are to be executed to test the work.
